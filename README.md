## Main screen

The user would be able to **view his pipeline statuses** in a list of dashboards. The dashboards are **themed** to the services they represent.

The two buttons on the main dashboard allow the user to either refresh the screen or toggle the extended section below, exposing further information about the repository/pipelines.
